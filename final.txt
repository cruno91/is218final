1. Unit testing is when small pieces of code are tested with computer modules together and tested with certain test procedures to see if they are ready for use.The goal of unit testing is to isolate each part of the program and show taht the individual parts are correct.  As a result it offers several benefits; find problems early, fasciliates change, simplifies integeration, documentation, and design.
2. Functional testing is a system of testing of software or hardware conducted on a complete, integrated system to evaluate the system's complicance.  It is implemented by being checked against the design documents and specifications.  It is important because it tests what the output data of a given input data would be based on a test case.  It tells if the functionality of the site is working.
3. Automated unit testing acts as a design document specifying the form and behavior of a desired soulution when it comes to software design. The unit test can be used to verify that the implementation of the software obeys the design. The unit tests will never pass if the developer does not implement the solution according to the design.
